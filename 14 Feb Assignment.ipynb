    "'''Q1. What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading in Python refers to the process of executing multiple threads or parallel threads simultaneously. A thread is a lightweight sub-process that can run concurrently with other threads. Python provides a built-in module called threading to handle threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is used in Python to improve the performance of an application by allowing multiple threads to run simultaneously. It is useful for tasks that involve I/O-bound operations, such as reading or writing to files, networking, and database operations. By using threads, the application can perform these tasks in the background while the main thread continues to execute other tasks.\n",

    "The threading module provides a Thread class that can be used to create and manage threads. It also provides other classes and functions for synchronization and communication between threads."

    "1.-Increased performance: Multithreading allows for multiple threads to execute simultaneously, thereby increasing the overall performance of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.-Responsiveness: Multithreading allows for a program to be more responsive as the main thread can continue to execute while other threads are working in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.-Resource sharing: Multiple threads can share resources such as memory and CPU time, which can result in better utilization of resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.-Modular programming: Multithreading allows for a program to be broken down into smaller modules, each of which can be executed by a separate thread, making the code more manageable and easier to debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.-Complexity: Multithreaded programming can be complex and difficult to implement, especially when dealing with shared resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.-Synchronization issues: When multiple threads are accessing shared resources, it can result in synchronization issues such as race conditions and deadlocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.-Debugging: Debugging multithreaded programs can be difficult and time-consuming, as bugs may only occur sporadically or under specific conditions.\n",
    "\n",

    "'''6. Explain deadlocks and race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlock and race condition are two types of problems that can occur in a multithreaded environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting on each other to release a resource, but none of them can proceed as they are waiting for the other thread to release the resource. As a result, the threads become blocked and cannot proceed, causing the program to freeze or become unresponsive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race condition occurs when two or more threads access a shared resource concurrently, and the final outcome of the program depends on the order in which the threads execute. If the threads are not properly synchronized, the program may produce unexpected results or even crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between the two is that deadlock involves threads waiting for each other to release resources, while race condition involves threads accessing the same resource concurrently without proper synchronization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlocks and race conditions can be avoided by using proper synchronization techniques such as locks, semaphores, and barriers. These techniques help to ensure that only one thread can access a resource at a time, or that threads are properly synchronized when accessing shared resources."
