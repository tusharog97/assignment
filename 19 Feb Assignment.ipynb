    "#Q1. What is Flask Framework? What are the advantages of Flask Framework?\n",
    "\n",
    "'''Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the advantages of using Flask include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lightweight: Flask is a lightweight framework that is easy to install and requires minimal dependencies, making it a great choice for building small to medium-sized web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible: Flask allows developers to have complete control over the structure and components of their web applications. It supports a wide range of extensions that can be used to add functionality as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy to learn: Flask has a simple and intuitive API that is easy to learn and use, even for developers who are new to Python or web development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good documentation: Flask has excellent documentation that is clear, concise, and easy to follow, making it easy to get started with the framework and build web applications quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalable: Flask can be used to build applications of any size and complexity, from small personal projects to large enterprise applications. It is designed to be modular and extensible, which makes it easy to add new features and scale up as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pythonic: Flask follows the \"Pythonic\" way of doing things, which means that it is easy to read, write, and maintain. It also integrates well with other Python libraries and tools, making it a natural choice for Python developers.'''\n"
