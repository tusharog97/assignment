    "In Python, the open() function is used to open a file. The open() function returns a file object that can be used to read, write, and manipulate the contents of the file.\n",
    "The syntax for the open() function is as follows:'''\n",
    "\n",
    "file_object = open(filename, mode)\n",
    "\n",
    "'''Where filename is a string that contains the name of the file you want to open and mode is a string that specifies the mode in which you want to open the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several modes for opening a file, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "r (read mode): This mode opens the file for reading (default mode). If the file does not exist, it will raise a FileNotFoundError. This mode is used to read the contents of a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "w (write mode): This mode opens the file for writing. If the file already exists, it will truncate the file (i.e., delete all the contents of the file). If the file does not exist, it will create a new file. This mode is used to write to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "a (append mode): This mode opens the file for appending. If the file already exists, it will not truncate the file. Instead, it will append the new data to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, it will create a new file. This mode is used to add data to the end of a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "x (exclusive creation mode): This mode opens the file for exclusive creation, which means that the file must not already exist. If the file already exists, it will raise a FileExistsError. This mode is used to create a new file, but only if it does not already exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "b (binary mode): This mode opens the file in binary mode, which means that the data is read or written as a sequence of bytes. This mode is used when working with non-text files, such as image files or audio files.\n",
    "\n",
    "t (text mode): This mode opens the file in text mode, which means that the data is read or written as a sequence of strings. This mode is used when working with text files, such as .txt files.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ (read and write mode): This mode opens the file for both reading and writing. This mode is used when you want to read from and write to the same file.'''"

    "'''Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the close() function is used to close a file. It is important to close a file after you have finished working with it because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1-Resource management: When you open a file, the operating system assigns a resource (known as a file descriptor) to that file. If you do not close the file, the resource will remain assigned to the file, which can lead to resource exhaustion. Closing the file releases the resource back to the operating system, making it available for other processes to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "2-Data consistency: When you write data to a file, the operating system may buffer the data in memory before writing it to the file. If you do not close the file, the buffered data may not be written to the file, leading to data loss or corruption. Closing the file ensures that any buffered data is written to the file before the file is closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3-Security: If you do not close a file, it may be accessible to other processes or users on the system, which can compromise the security of your data. Closing the file ensures that it is no longer accessible to other processes or users.\n",
    "\n",
    "4-iPortability: While many operating systems automatically close files when a program exits, relying on this behavior can lead to portability issues. Closing the file explicitly ensures that the program behaves consistently across different platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it is important to always close a file after you have finished working with it using the close() function. Alternatively, you can use the with statement, which automatically closes the file when you are done working with it. For example:'''\n",
