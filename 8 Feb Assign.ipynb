    "# Q2. Differentiate between Abstraction and Encapsulation. Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "'''Abstraction and Encapsulation are two important concepts in object-oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is a way to show only the necessary details of an object and hide the unnecessary details. It helps to simplify complex systems by breaking them down into smaller and more manageable parts. In other words, Abstraction is the concept of \"showing only the necessary things to the outside world and hiding the rest.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a car is an abstraction of a complex system of components such as the engine, transmission, wheels, and many other parts. The driver of the car doesn't need to know how the engine or transmission work, but only needs to know how to operate the steering wheel, brake pedal, and accelerator. The details of the engine and transmission are abstracted away, and the driver can focus on driving the car safely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation, on the other hand, is a way to protect data and methods from being accessed by outside code. It is the concept of \"hiding the internal workings of an object from the outside world.\" This can be achieved by using access modifiers such as private, public, and protected.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a bank account is encapsulated because only the owner of the account can access the account details and perform transactions. The bank uses the concept of encapsulation to protect the account data and ensure that only authorized people can access the account.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Abstraction is the concept of hiding unnecessary details and showing only the necessary ones, while Encapsulation is the concept of protecting the data and methods from outside access.'''\n"
