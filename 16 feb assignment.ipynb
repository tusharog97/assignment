    "''''Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and managed in a way that allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data. Databases are used in various applications, such as websites, mobile apps, and enterprise software, to store and manage data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL are two types of database management systems that differ in their approach to data storage and management:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that store data in tables with predefined relationships between them. SQL databases use a schema to define the structure of the data and ensure that the data conforms to that structure. SQL databases are known for their ability to handle complex queries and transactions reliably and efficiently. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that store data in flexible, unstructured formats, such as key-value pairs, document-based, graph-based or columnar databases. NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured data and can scale horizontally easily, making them a popular choice for web-scale applications. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases often depends on the specific use case and requirements of the application. SQL databases are ideal for applications that require strong data consistency, complex queries, and transactions, while NoSQL databases are better suited for applications that need to handle large volumes of unstructured data, require horizontal scaling, and flexible data models.'''"

    "\n",
    "DDL (Data Definition Language) is a set of SQL commands that are used to define and manipulate the structure of a database, \n",
    "including tables, indexes, and constraints. The following are some of the commonly used DDL commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "1-CREATE: The CREATE command is used to create a new database object, such as a table, index, or constraint. For example, \n",
    "the following SQL statement creates a new table named \"customers\" with columns for customer name, address, and email:'''\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE customers (\n",
    "  customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "  customer_name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "  customer_address VARCHAR(100),\n",
    "  customer_email VARCHAR(50)\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "2-DROP: The DROP command is used to remove an existing database object, such as a table, index, or constraint. For example, the following SQL statement drops the \"customers\" table:'''\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP TABLE customers;\n",
    "'''\n",
    "3- ALTER: The ALTER command is used to modify the structure of an existing database object, such as adding or dropping columns from a table. For example, the following SQL statement adds a new column \"customer_phone\" to the \"customers\" table:'''\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE customers ADD customer_phone VARCHAR(20);\n",
    "\n",
    "''''\n",
    "4- TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE command is used to remove all data from an existing table, while keeping the table structure intact. For example, the following SQL statement removes all data from the \"customers\" table:'''\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE customers;\n",
    "\n",
    "'''These DDL commands are important tools for database administrators and developers to create, modify,\n",
    "and manage the structure of a database. They enable the creation of new tables, the removal of existing tables,\n",

    "\n",

    "INSERT INTO customers (customer_name, customer_address, customer_email)\n",
    "VALUES ('John Smith', '123 Main St', 'john.smith@example.com');\n",
    "\n",
    "2-UPDATE: The UPDATE command is used to modify existing data in a table. For example, the following SQL statement updates the \"customer_email\" for the customer with the \"customer_id\" of 1 in the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE customers\n",
    "SET customer_email = 'newemail@example.com'\n",
    "WHERE customer_id = 1;\n",
    "\n",
    "3-DELETE: The DELETE command is used to remove data from a table. For example, the following SQL statement deletes the row with the \"customer_id\" of 2 from the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "DELETE FROM customers\n",
    "WHERE customer_id = 2;\n",
    "\n",
    "These DML commands are essential for managing the data stored in a database. They enable the insertion of new data, the modification of existing data, and the removal of unwanted data, which can be used to keep the data in the database up-to-date, accurate, and consistent.

    "DQL (Data Query Language) is a set of SQL commands that are used to retrieve data from a database. The most commonly used DQL command is SELECT, which is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database.\n",

    "'''Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "data integrity and consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in the table. Primary keys are used to enforce the entity integrity constraint, which ensures that each row in a table is unique and can be identified by a unique identifier. The primary key is typically chosen based on the characteristics of the data, such as a customer ID, an order number, or a product SKU.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a \"customers\" table with columns for customer_id, customer_name, and customer_email. The customer_id column can be used as the primary key to uniquely identify each customer in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. Foreign keys are used to enforce the referential integrity constraint, which ensures that the data in one table is consistent with the data in another table. A foreign key establishes a relationship between two tables, such as a \"parent-child\" relationship or a \"one-to-many\" relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider an \"orders\" table with columns for order_id, order_date, and customer_id. The customer_id column in the \"orders\" table can be used as a foreign key that refers to the customer_id primary key column in the \"customers\" table. This establishes a \"one-to-many\" relationship between the \"customers\" and \"orders\" tables, where each customer can have multiple orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, primary keys and foreign keys are important concepts in database design that help ensure data integrity and consistency. Primary keys are used to uniquely identify each row in a table, while foreign keys are used to establish relationships between tables and enforce referential integrity constraints.\n",
